ðŸ§© IPL Cricket Match Data Integration | SSIS, SQL, ETL

This project involved building a complete ETL pipeline using SSIS to integrate, transform, and load IPL cricket match data into a structured data warehouse. The main goal was to clean and prepare raw match data for analysis and reporting.

Key Highlights:

Extracted raw CSV files containing match, player, and ball-by-ball data.
Performed data validation, cleansing, and transformation using Derived Columns, Data Conversions, and Conditional Splits.
Implemented Lookup transformations for dimension mapping (teams, players, venues, etc.).
Handled bad data and null values with error redirection and logging mechanisms.
Designed fact and dimension tables using star schema for optimized reporting.
Loaded cleaned and enriched data into SQL Server tables using OLE DB Destination.
Ensured incremental data loading and added logging and success/error handling for pipeline reliability.

This project enhanced my understanding of data modeling, ETL architecture, and real-time data integration in a structured environment. It also improved my skills in SQL development, SSIS components, and data warehousing best practices.
